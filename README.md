## This project was developed at Bosch 2020 Hackathon 

This repository consists of the code needed to be able to compute parking availability with 2 ultrasonics sensors with a GPS provided by our smartphone (see this https://github.com/EpsilonZ/GPSReporter_Android for getting the required app which will report the GPS data).
